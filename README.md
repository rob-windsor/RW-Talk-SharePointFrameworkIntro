# An Introduction to Development with the SharePoint Framework

The SharePoint Framework (SPFx) is a page and web part model that provides full support for client-side SharePoint development, easy integration with SharePoint data, and the ability to extend Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Viva Connections. Microsoft uses SPFx to build the modern list and library user experiences you see in SharePoint Online. Developing for the SharePoint Framework is nothing like classic SharePoint development. There’s no File | New Project in Visual Studio; instead you’ll be using tools like Node, Yeoman, Gulp and TypeScript. This session will introduce you to the SharePoint Framework, show you how to setup your development environment, introduce you to the types of customizations you can build using SPFx, and show you how to build and deploy a SPFx web part.
